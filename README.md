# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS-AI-ML


--Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
For this class, we were given code for a maze environment, experience replay, and a neural network. 
The aim of the project was to develop a Q-training algorithm using deep-Q learning. 
The goal of the algorithm was to reach the end of the maze before visiting too many cells, hitting 
too many walls, or trying to leave the bounds of the maze too many times.

(TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py were provided by SNHU)
    
--Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        -What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        -How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        -What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    
Computer scientists are responsible for creating programs which power most of the modern technology used today. 
As a computer scientist, I try to approach problems by first gaining a thorough understanding of the requirements, 
planning how these may be converted into code and executed, coding, testing, and finally delivering the result to the end user. 
Beyond this, I am responsible for creating programs ethically, whether it be in the source of code I use, its overall purpose, 
privacy implications, and impact on users and the organization. Code I create should have a clear purpose that is communicated 
to the user (within reason, not all technical details are needed by someone using a weather app, for example) such that users 
know how their information is being used and can opt out as desired.
